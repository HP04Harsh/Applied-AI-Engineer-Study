# Applied AI Engineer Study

Hands-on exercises and small projects documenting my journey toward becoming
an **Applied AI Engineer**. This repository currently focuses on Python
fundamentals and Bash scripting, with room to grow into automation, machine
learning, generative AI, and deployment.

## Python exercises

The [`python/`](python/) directory contains standalone examples covering:

- VAT calculations: [`check_vat.py`](python/check_vat.py)
- Iterating over paired lists: [`enumerate-food.py`](python/enumerate-food.py)
- The `nonlocal` keyword and nested functions: [`nonlocal_keyword.py`](python/nonlocal_keyword.py)
- A temperature loop: [`tea-heating.py`](python/tea-heating.py)
- Conditional temperature and device-state checks: [`themostat-alert.py`](python/themostat-alert.py)
- `match`/`case` selection for train seats: [`train-info.py`](python/train-info.py)
- Coupon discounts: [`user-discount.py`](python/user-discount.py)

Run an exercise with Python 3:

```bash
python python/check_vat.py
```

`train-info.py` uses structural pattern matching and requires Python 3.10 or
newer. Some exercises prompt for input; follow the prompts in the terminal.

## Bash exercises

The [`bash/`](bash/) directory contains scripts for:

- Creating a timestamped archive backup: [`backupfile-script.sh`](bash/backupfile-script.sh)
- Renaming `.txt` files to `.md`: [`bulk-rename.sh`](bash/bulk-rename.sh)
- Checking root filesystem usage: [`disk-monitor.sh`](bash/disk-monitor.sh)
- Displaying a system health summary: [`healthdashboard.sh`](bash/healthdashboard.sh)
- Navigating a simple system-information menu: [`interactive-menu.sh`](bash/interactive-menu.sh)
- Checking whether a local system user exists: [`user-check.sh`](bash/user-check.sh)

Run a script from a Bash-compatible environment:

```bash
bash bash/disk-monitor.sh
```

These scripts are intended for Linux or a compatible environment such as WSL.
Some use system utilities or paths that may not be available on other
operating systems. Review a script before running it, especially when it
reads, modifies, or archives files.

## Learning goals

- Build practical programming and automation skills.
- Strengthen Linux, Bash, and Python fundamentals.
- Progress toward machine learning, generative AI, MLOps, and reliable AI
  application development.

The examples are learning exercises and are not intended as production-ready
tools.
